# Constant memory yaml2json and json2yaml in C++

This project provides the command line utilities yaml2json
and json2yaml, written in c++.

It aims at supporting the subset of yaml that can be
directly represented in json. Advanced yaml features, like
anchors, NaN, Infinity or tags are not supported, but
a sensible, configurable handling of those may be added in
the future.

## Installation

Make sure you have the git submodules checked out and then
run:

```
make
```

To install copy the binaries to /usr/bin/local.

## Why?

Most of the yaml/json conversion tools I found where written
in javascript or ruby; they load the entire JSON/YAML file
into memory, convert it – also in memory – and then print
the result.
Thus the memory requirement of these programs is greater
than the size of the input file plus the size of the output
file.

This project utilizes a streaming approach: Reading data,
conversion and writing the output are all done in parallel,
using the same amount of memory, regardless how large the
input file is.

yaml2json still has a bug that makes it leak memory a rate
of 1/100 of the input file, while json2yaml usually requires
less than 10mb of memory, regardless of the input file size.

NOTE: yaml2json and json2yaml still need to read each node
in whole, so if you have a 20MB base64 encoded file in your
json, this will need to be red into memory in whole.

This project does not provide any significant speed
improvements over other implementations at the moemnt, but
I am very open to optimizations and expect that
a performance improvement of 50x could be reached.

## Status

This project seems to be working, but it is not extensively
tested and definitely needs unit tests.
It relies on a quick patch of yaml-cpp I wrote, that adds
support for preserving type information.

This should be working well enough for personal used, but
I do not recommend employing it in a production environment.
